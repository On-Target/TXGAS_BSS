<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Effective Date: March 28, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Centric Infrastructure Group <span style="color: black;">(“<u>Centric</u>,” “<u>our</u>,” “<u>us</u>” or “<u>we</u>”) </span>recognizes and respect your right to privacy. We are providing this privacy policy (this “<u><span style="color: black;">Privacy Policy</span></u>”) to help you better understand the type of Personal Information we collect through the website currently located at https://centric-us.com/ and its subdomains (collectively, the “<u>Website</u>”) or when you call or email us to make a request for information. This Privacy Policy also describes how and why we collect or share this information and tells you about your rights and choices about the use of that Personal Information. By using our Website, you agree with our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with any Personal Information through our Website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with other documents that we provide to you. This documentation may include sections relating to the use and disclosure of information. Where a conflict exists between the terms of this Privacy Policy and any other document in relation to data protection, the terms of this Privacy Policy will apply. The policies described in this Privacy Policy continue to apply even if your relationship with us ends.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information we collect, other than Personal Information collected from the sources discussed below. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information about businesses or other non-individuals. We reserve the right to use and disclose aggregated and deidentified information for any commercially reasonable purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Types of Personal Information Collected and How We Collect It</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>“<u>Personal Information</u>” refers to information that reasonably allows us to identify you, individually. We collect Personal Information you voluntarily provide, including when you contact us via phone, email, or our “<a href="https://centric-us.com/contact.html">Contact Us</a>” webform. Such Personal Information may include your name, email, and any other information you voluntarily share with us in such interactions. From visitors to the Career page of our website (“<u>Applicants</u>”), we collect Personal Information such as name, phone number, email and desired position. We also collect Personal Information contained on resumes voluntarily uploaded by Applicants.</p>
<p>We have grouped together the following categories of Personal Information to more easily explain how we use this information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11px;"> </span>“<u>Personal Identifiers</u>,” including your first name and last name;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11px;"> </span>“<u>Contact Information</u>,” including your email address(es), mailing address(es), phone number(s); and</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11px;"> </span>“<u>Biographical Information</u>,” including your gender, occupation, citizenship, marital status, level of education and professional background.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 0in;"><u>Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</u>. We use tracking technologies, such as “cookies” and “web beacons”, which are also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or pixels. “Cookies” are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the website, and allow a website to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. “Web beacons” are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of our Online Services and effectiveness of communication. These web beacons can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website. Like many companies, we may from time to time use “cookie” and other tracking technologies on our Website. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your online activities. Our Website does not currently support Do Not Track requests.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext;">“<u>Traffic Data</u>” may be collected when you browse our Website or use our Online Services. For example, Centric may collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our Website. Centric may also collect information from visitors to our Website regarding the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to our website, and the pages of our Website that you viewed during your visit, how much time you spend on pages of our website, the time and date of your visit, similar statistics, and any search terms entered while visiting our website or using our Website. </span>Centric may also access broadband traffic through deep packet inspection or similar means for the purposes of general maintenance and management of the network, as well as access broadband traffic upon request as required by law enforcement officials or court order.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Centric uses your Personal Information to provide you with information you have requested.</p>

<p>Centric may also use your Personal Information to periodically send you marketing e-mails or other company information that we believe may be of interest to you. Centric will not send you text messages unless you have agreed to receive them.</p>
<p>Centric may use Traffic Data as described in the section above.</p>
<p>Other than to a buyer or successor of our business, Centric does not rent or sell your Personal Information to any third party.</p>

<p>We use the various Google Adwords features to advertise on third party websites, including Google, to previous visitors to our website. With Remarketing, third-party vendors use Cookies (including third-party Cookies such as those from DoubleClick) to provide our advertisements on the Internet based upon your past visits to our website, and with Demographics and Interest Reporting, we use aggregate data provided (such as age, gender, and interests) to understand and communicate better with visitors to our website. You may opt-out of Google’s use of Adwords by adjusting your advertising settings or by downloading the browser add-on discussed above.

<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sharing and Retention Your Personal Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may disclose the Personal Information described above to certain third parties as authorized by you, or as permitted or required by law or regulation. More specifically, we may share Personal Information where:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations or with your instructions;</li>
<li>We have a public or legal duty to do so (for example, to assist with detecting and preventing fraud, tax evasion and financial crime or compliance with a court order);</li>
<li>We are obligated to in connection with regulatory reporting, litigation or asserting or defending legal rights and interests;</li>
<li>Necessary to protect our system, protect your security or the security of others and to prosecute those responsible for breaching it;</li>
<li>Needed to allow us to provide you with necessary or useful services, for example sharing with affiliates and service providers, including administrators, hosting providers, governmental agencies, regulatory organizations, and consultants;</li>
<li>It is to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets that relate to our Website; and</li>
<li>We have asked you if we can share it, and you gave consent.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 0in;">We may also share certain demographic information with advertisers and other third parties, but only on an aggregate basis. Personal Information we collect from you may be kept for as long as it is required for legitimate business purposes, to perform contractual obligations, or for such longer periods as required or permitted by applicable legal or regulatory obligations. We may also be allowed to retain your Personal Information for a longer period if you have given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Protection of Your Personal Information </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Centric takes precautions to protect your Personal Information that we collect and process against unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. These measures include storing the Personal Information we retain on a secure server, which is only accessible by authorized personnel. To the extent we provide your Personal Information to any third parties, we will request that they use reasonable security measures to protect your information.</p>
<p>However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we diligently pursue efforts to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you provide such information at your own risk. We also encourage you to protect any usernames, passwords or other credentials you use to access our Website and to use a password that you do not use on any other website or with any other online services.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Privacy Protection of Children’s Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) protects the online privacy and personal information of children under thirteen (13) years of age. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use our Website and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 without verified parental consent, we will delete that user’s Personal Information from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parents’ permission before submitting information to us over the Internet. By using our Website, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</strong></li>

<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information. When you receive promotional communications from us via e-mail, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the promotional e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly at info@unigas-tx.com. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative e-mails regarding Centric services, including, for example, administrative confirmations, and notices of updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may change any of your profile information by editing it in the profile settings page. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at info@unigas-tx.com, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request, only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete your Personal Information, it will be deleted from our active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Third Party Links and Websites</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our Website, including this Privacy Policy, may contain links to other third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of the services at those links or those websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any other services or website before permitting them to collect or use your Personal Information.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Updates and Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Centric reserves the right to change, modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event of any modification, we will post the changes in this Privacy Policy so that you will always know what information we are gathering and how we might use that information. However, if such changes are material, we will either announce the change on the home page of the site or take such other action as we deem appropriate under the circumstances.
